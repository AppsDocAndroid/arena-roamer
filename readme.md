ArenaRoamer
===========

A basic arena roaming game. Could be used as the basis of a basic GTA/Doom/Wolfenstein/3DMonsterMaze game.

Levels are loaded from file. They consist of walls, doors that open on touch (unless locked and no keys in inventory), gems (collectables), keys (used to unlock doors), and an exit (main objective). Simple gameplay boils down to "get to the exit with as many gems as possible".

Toggle ArenaRoamer RENDER_3D flag to render in either 2D (from above) or 3D (first person view).

Player controls:
Turn left/right - cursor left/right on desktop, touch left/right side of screen on android
Move forward/backward - cursor up/down on desktop, tilt forward/backward on android
Strafe left/right - keys z/x on desktop, tilt left/right on android

I plan to develop this into a non-violent first person arcade adventure puzzler, suitable for all ages and all devices.

I'll be blogging about the project here - http://theinvader360.blogspot.co.uk/

PS: This is very much based on trial and error learning, please do not assume that anything I do here is the "right" way of doing things!
